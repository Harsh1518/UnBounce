## Roles and Responsibilities

- On the first day of the project, we have planned how will we going to start and who will going to do which part.
- We have divided the task wisely among the team members.
- We organized a meeting daily to know the progress and lagging if any.

## Challenges

Main Challenge was to do the work on time since one member was a working professional due to this we were lagging and another has his exams so he was also not participating too much. We have done it wisely by distributing their work to other members.

## Conclusions

Learning technology is a different thing and showing what you have learned is a different thing. This project has given us the confidence to showcase whatever we have learned so far. This project also help us to learn those concepts, which can be gained only by practically doing, that canâ€™t be taught during classes. Lastly, I would like to thank all the team members of the group who coordinate remotely and let the project go smoothly.

## Deployment
